Data Sources: For FishCounts and Fishcounts (1), data on Nugashik river fish returns for sockeye salmon, I downloaded the data from Alaska's department of fish and game, located in Alaska. https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/sf/FishCounts/index.cfm?ADFG=main.displayResults

For the data on sea conditions, I downloaded it from the EPA database. https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/oceans#:~:text=When%20averaged%20over%20all%20of,the%20land%20vary%20by%20region.

The data found in fishcounts are daily updates from the past 15 years on fish running upstream in the Nugashik River, one of the rivers in the largest salmon run in America in Bristol Bay, broken down by year. The data found in the EPA datasets include information from the past 30 years on ocean levels, temperatures, acidity, surface temperature, and marine species distribution.

This topic matters greatly to me. As a commercial fisherman, I have seen average fish size shrink over time. The reason for this is relatively unclear. People hypothesize fish are returning sooner to spawn than they used to, that they have less food, or that rising ocean temps and pockets of warm water are responsible. Regardless, I have seen the impact, and want to explore the topic more and communicate what is going on.

I would hope to use this data to illustrate how oceans have changed over the past several years, and hopefully simultaneously show how fishing in Alaska has changed. I may be able to map the data in the oceans, and use graphs and charts to show how it has impacted fishing. Potential data points included annual fish counts, date range for peak of salmon run, annual ocean acidity, temperature, biodiversity, and ocean levels.

My only concerns about the data are date range for fishing counts. Thus far I have only been able to find data going back to 2010 for the Nugashik river. Ideally, I would hope to find data going further back, but will continue to see if any other rivers in the bay have older datasets.

The data on fish counts is a primary data set, collected by observers on fish towers that report directly to Alaska fish and game. The EPA dataset, I am unsure if it is secondary of primary, but for safety will assume secondary. In that case, I wouldd assume the EPA has collected and cleaned the data, but not changed or impacted it significantly.
