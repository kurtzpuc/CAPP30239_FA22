#PIPER KURTZ

Hi! My name is Piper Kurtz, and I a second-year MSCAPP student at Harris School for Public Policy. I am originally from Anchorage, Alaska, where I was born and raised. I commercial fished for king and red salmon most summers from age 17 - 24, when I came to Harris. Prior to coming to school I also worked as a high school math and science teacher in Kona, Hawai'i. I am extremely interested in this course. Data literacy in my home is minimal, so data use and collection is sparse. I am looking to gain the skills necessary to help facilitate my home in becoming a more tech savvy state, the first step being becoming someone who can communicate data well in visual formats that connect to viewers.
